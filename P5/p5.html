      <h2>Assignment #6 Data Portrait</h2>
      <p>
        In this assignment, we need to collect data around us to convert it into images. 
        What I chose was how many times I clicked the skip button on the music app within 
        a week. If I clicked the space bar first, it would play the song I listened to the 
        most times last year. The skipping criteria for clicking on a character is to switch 
        between different backgrounds to express the location where I often listen to songs, 
        while the large and small dots express the mood when clicking for different purposes.
